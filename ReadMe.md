To read the charts generated by the code, you can follow these guidelines:

1. Temperature Range Chart:

The x-axis represents the dates.
The y-axis represents the temperature range in Celsius (°C).
Each bar in the chart represents the temperature range for a specific date.
The height of the bar represents the temperature range, with the bottom of the bar indicating the minimum temperature and the top indicating the maximum temperature.

2. Weather Condition Chart:

The chart is a pie chart representing the distribution of different weather conditions.
Each slice of the pie represents a weather condition.
The size of each slice represents the count or frequency of that particular weather condition.

3. Weather Forecast Table:

The table displays the weather forecast data for each date.
The first column represents the date.
The second column represents the minimum temperature in Celsius (°C).
The third column represents the maximum temperature in Celsius (°C).
The fourth column represents the weather condition.
By analyzing the charts and table, you can gain insights into the temperature range and weather conditions for the specified city over the forecasted period.
